**Project:** Explaining Public Budgets with Fuzzy Driven Summaries
**Authors:** Vlada Svirsh, Bohdan Potuzhnyi

## Contribution of team member

Bohdan: Did the main contribution to the implementation of the prototype: data pipeline (API/CSV loading, aggregation, 
share computation), trend estimation (Theil–Sen), fuzzy labeling, deterministic JSON responses, and reproducibility/testing 
checks. Also contributed to presentations by preparing the technical content and implementation details.

## Contribution of myself

I worked mainly on the citizen-facing and evaluation side of the project. Defined and refined the use-case scenarios 
and requirements (what the system should answer, and how it should behave for citizens). Helped shape the wording and 
presentation of outputs (timeframe + units + confidence notes) to keep summaries readable and transparent. Implemented 
and iterated the Streamlit UI to reduce raw JSON usage problem and make interaction feel more “chat-like”. Coordinated 
the two evaluation rounds (Round 1 API/JSON and Round 2 Streamlit), collected participant ratings and notes, and 
summarized qualitative feedback into themes/quotes for the results/discussion. Contributed to report writing and 
editing, mainly the framing sections (intro/use case/requirements) and discussion/lessons learned, plus final 
formatting cleanup.
